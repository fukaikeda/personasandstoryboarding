            <p class="highlight" id="background">Background Information</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The <b><a href="browndesignworkshop.org">Brown Design Workshop</a></b> is a makerspace 
                located in Brown University's engineering building, open to all. It's ususally busy with students and community
                members realazing their creative ambitions. <br>
                <br>
                Although it is a very exciting space, it has over 1000 members and this means the place
                is often very busy and welcomes a variety of users. Sometimes, as a monitor, I notice users
                have issues in the interaction with different components. <br>
                <br>
                Therefore, I decided to look into the interaction and evaluating the users needs, to 
                help us find a long-term solution for increasing usability.

            <p class="highlight" id="prusa">The Prusa Interface</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The Prusas are the printers that the BDW uses in its space.
                While it has a relatively simple interface, with one SD card slot, a knob to twist and press,
                and another cancel button, this simpleness may limit the controls possible on the interface.
                The LCD screen is also very small, and does not respond to input,
                which limits the information that users can both recieve and input.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph"> One concern I had after interaction with the interface itself
                is how many of the settings are 'bundled' together, and the difficult callibration
                settings are often mixed up with the print settings, which may provide a 'black hole'
                experience for the beginning users.

            <p class="paragraph">Based on the initial discoveries I had with the Prusa printer
                itself, I decided that my observations were going to be of three different users:
                a beginning, intermediate, and advanced users. By observing the actions of each
                level of user, I could get insight into a variety of experiences.

            <p class="paragraph">From these interviews, we find that each level user has different frusterations with the
                interaction of a 3d printer. It is observed that beginning users have more issues with the software-specific 
                interaction components of the 3d printer experience, while more advanced users have trouble with the systematic
                interactions within the experience, that is more related to interpersonal expereience. This may mean that the 3dp 
                interface is quite easily learnable, but not the best callibrated towards the nature of the space.

            <p class="highlight" id="personas">Personas</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As mentioned in the last section, these users have such different experiences. Therefore, I begin to focus on a more
                niche user. I do this by creating two personas based on the observations I conducted. They are both beginners,
            but have different struggles.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Then, I focus even more on a specific user by taking their journey and storyboarding it. This 
                process allows us to understand the specific points in a user's journey and their emotions in each,

            <p class="paragraph">From this activity, we can understand that the lack of support and confusion is a key point in 
                a negative experience of a beginning user, and that it can scare away users from using the devices. This is both
                something that the software can improve on (beginner-friendly debugging) but also the environment itself (support system).

        <p class="highlight" id="reflection">Reflections</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This activity helped me understand the different users of the 3D printers in
                the BDW and how each users interacts with them. Particularly, reviewing the users that are in
                a category the 'furthest away' from us helped me realize what changes are needed to make the
                technology useful for everyone.<br>
                <br>
                While software changes are difficult to implement on my level, there are a variety of 
                methods for myself to be involved in increasing the usability, such as providing more directed
                education during workshops, creating signage to help users, and be avaliable to answer questions. 
                I want to implement these changes to make the 3DP experience better for a wide audience.
